            <h3>Chapter 1: Unpleasent Introductions</h3>
            <p>
                The book opens with a single page prologue that I will include with chapter one given its length.
                The prologue is a cold open on the scene of her assumed demise. We get a few descriptors of her
                assailant and how her death is noble because it is to spare another. Not a whole lot of context but 
                man, oh man, am I now brimming with excitement to find out how we got here!!
            </p>
            <p>
                We then cut to the main story and it is here that we get to meet Bella. She is in the process of moving 
                back to her childhood home in Forks, WA, with her father. Something the Bella absolutely HATES but is
                something that she is willingly choosing to do? She keeps this bad attitude pretty much the whole chapter.
                She arrives in Forks and is bummed that she has to ride with her father to the house because she
                doesn't want to put in the effort to talk to him. While in the car she complains internally. 
                She complains about having to call him "dad" instead of his full name, Charlie. She then complains about
                needing to buy a car because she refuses to be driven to school by her father. When her dad tells her he
                got her a car so she wont need to buy one she interrogates him to find out the age of the car and is
                upset to learn that its an old truck. To her credit, she ends up loving the car and properly saying thanks
                to Charlie, but come on.
            </p>
            <p>
                We get a picture into what the home life will be like. Both Charlie and Bella waking up early, Charlie leaving
                first and the Bella following later to go to school. We are then given a tour of the house, kinda. We get a
                decent picture painted that Charlie has clearly not moved on from his marriage and has been a loving, observational
                parent for Bella (because she hates visiting him and only ever gave him 1 month a year, but then that was changed 
                to two weeks a year in Cali because, and get this, she hates visiting him).

                    Instead of letting that description reveal these character traits for Charlie, the book makes sure you 
                    understand by writing "Charlie had never gotten over &lt;Bella's&gt; mom"
                </small>
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, where was I? Oh right, she goes to school and is nervous, understandable. In her classes she begins to
                meet her classmates. We are introduced to Eric, Jessica, and Mike. Eric is described as a "boy with skin problems" 
                and very black hair. Jessica is "serveral inches shorter than &lt;Bella's&gt; five foot four", so she is shockingly
                short. Lastly, Mike is "a cute, baby-faced boy" with spiked hair. Before meeting Mike happens we are introduced to 
                the Cullen family children Edward, Emmet, Rosalie, Jasper, and Alice. 
                They are all described in the same way that people describe marble statues from the old masters. Beautiful bodies and faces.
                She ends up having a class with Edward and he makes faces at her the whole time and is acting like he's revolted or something.
                Mike even brings that up wondering what she did to him. She finishes her first school day sitting in her truck in the 
                parking lot thinking about that interraction with Edward. Eventually she gets cold and drives home trying not to cry.
            </p>
            <p>
                So listen... She spends this entire chapter bemoaning her situation. Complaining about everything and everyone.
                She thinks people will stare or pry too much, and mostly people treat her nice and seem interested in being friends.
                She has seemingly endless words for how little she wants to be associated with Charlie and then he buys her a car
                with no thought to getting the money back from her. I get that she doesn't want to be there, but you would think
                that if it was your own choice you would at least try to make the best of it.
